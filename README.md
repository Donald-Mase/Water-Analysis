# Water-Analysis
## Configuring ML in water analysis project.
##Description
The project is an extension of a data analysis and visualization project that traces properties of water to determine potability.

#Installation 
Implementation employs the Django framework as a utility for backend operations. 
Editor: Pycharm IDE
Python version: 3.11

Data sources
Kaggle Datasets

Code structure
Explain the code structure and how it is organized, including any significant files and their purposes. This will help others understand how to navigate your project and find specific components.

#Python Packages Used
In this section, I include all the necessary dependencies needed to reproduce the project, so that the reader can install them before replicating the project. I categorize the long list of packages used as -

General Purpose: General purpose packages- urllib, os, request, and many more.
Data Manipulation: Packages used for handling and importing dataset such as pandas, numpy and others.
Machine Learning: Packages that were used to generate the ML model such as scikit, tensorflow, etc.


#Results and evaluation
The ultimate outcome is a project that supports user input and transforms the data using the model to give a simplified output that predicts whether water is safe as per the properties of interest.

#Future work
Extension of water properties that can be sampled.
Simplification of the data collection process.
